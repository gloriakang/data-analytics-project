## email_info (~2.6M records)
* VERY IMPORTANT
* Fields: id, date, user, pc, to, cc, bcc, from, size, attachment_count, content
* Per usual, emails can have multiple recipients
* Emails can be sent to non-employees. The company name is randomly initialized DTAA (there isnâ€™t any significance here), and can be used to identify other employees.
* Email size is in bytes, not including any possible attachments.
* Emails have carbon copy info.
* Per usual - content and subjects may not match
